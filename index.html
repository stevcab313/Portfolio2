            <p>
              After graduating from college with a Kinesiology degree and a minor in Health, I stayed in the restaurant business because of my passion for the creativity of delicious food. Having been a restaurant manager, each day brought new challenges for our team. The same collaboration of all the hands and minds that go into each project excites me to continue learning and progressing in my software develpoment career. I am quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving everyday one problem at a time.</p>
              
              <p>Outside of my work in software development, you can find me in the mountains exploring with our two dogs,finding new recipes to cook (Have you baked in high altitude?), or playing this new game called "Pickleball". Super addicting team game that is cross between ping pong and tennis.</p>
